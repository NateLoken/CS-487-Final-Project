For our project we used Google Collab so that all our members could work on the project.

A link is provided to both the Collab project and the Github but since we did not actively work on Github
you will only see one commit for the whole project at the very end.

To run our code in Collab:
- Open the link
- Select 'Runtime' -> 'Run all'
- Under 'Task 4' select 'Choose File'
- Browse to the provided 'bitcoin_data.csv' file

NOTE: Since Collab has this feature of selecting files to upload, there may be
some issues if you run the .py file directly outside of Collab
